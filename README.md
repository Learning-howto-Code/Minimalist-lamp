# Minimalist-lamp
Engineering never has enough design, so I wanted to bring a form over funtion design to Blueprint. Yes it's a lamp, but I want this to be more of a funtional decoration then a robot.
I designed this whole thing to be 3d printed in 2 parts, the lamp shade and legs. 
Awesome sauce features
- Can fit any standard size light bulb
- Lets you use any cable you want, like the custom cables I used.
- Can be made for under 10 dollars, so fill your house with them!
